Hii. My name is Felipe. 

Iâ€™m a undergrad Computer Science focusing on security. Welcome to my blog!

In this blog, I will explore different topics within cybersecurity. 
My goal is to talk about a lot of interesting topics, for example: web security, bug bounty, research, networks, hacking.

More details about me on my personal page [HERE](https://felipemsalles.github.io/).
