Hii. My name is Felipe. 

Iâ€™m a undergrad Computer Science student focusing on Cyber Security. Welcome to my blog!

In this blog, I will explore different topics within Cyber Security. 
My goal is to talk about a lot of interesting topics, for example: Web Security, Binary Exploitation, Bug Bounty, Research, Networks, and Hacking.
