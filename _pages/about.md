Hii. My name is Felipe. 

Iâ€™m a undergrad computer science focusing on security. Welcome to my blog!

In this blog, I will explore different topics within cybersecurity. 
My goal is to talk about a lot of interesting topics, for example: web security, bug bounty, research, networks, hacking.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions about something on this blog, hit me up on Twitter!
