Hundreds of thousands of people around the world were celebrating the beginning of another year. Now, every hope has been transformed exponentially in fear of the unknown, fear of losing their friends, parents, and family.

As Covid-19 starts spreading all around the world as easily as normal influenza, information security professionals are paying more attention to prevent a big impact on the life of many users around the globe. In these moments, crackers (bad hackers) â€” take advantage of this vulnerable situation to steal personal data, bank accounts, and, in many cases, offer personal information for sale.

There are several direct and indirect ways to explore these moments. For example, many countries are recommending their citizens to stay home. Hence, crackers explore the fear of many users by sending malwares, e-mails and fake messages asking for their personal data in order to steal something, either by cell phones or computer.

In the digital revolution, where a good deal of personal information is stored in devices, which provide easy access to them, crackers use their abilities to deceive some people based on their own benefits. Consequently, the number of digital crimes in these periods drastically increase due to the emotional state of many people. That's why everyone needs to be more attentive in order to prevent any problem.

In addition, crackers are developing their skills too fast, creating a great concern in many companies to assure the protection of users. Nowadays, the shortage of skilled labour is indirectly related to the increase of cyber criminals, although, in many cases, a lot of companies ignore this problem, placing thousands of people at risk around the world. In the graph below, it can be seen that the investment of many companies is still a long way from getting great results.

Nevertheless, it is realistic to expect that more crises will appear in the future, and these kind of people who thrive on moments of turmoil, making it worse, will continue trying to steal personal information. So, no matter crise you live, do not forget about your private information, and the dangers of surfing on the internet while society is experiencing difficult moments to protect everyone that you love and care about. Therefore: the digital revolution is great, but can be dangerous
